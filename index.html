    <p> Tone Jump
	by Garrick Liou (gliou@ucsc.edu) </p>

    <p>Tone Jump is a simple game that utilizes a microphone and a keyboard. It is a sort of artistic endeavor while also using a novel control scheme. The page starts with a ball in the top left corner, and a square goal. The microphone starts off activated, and will record the pitch of the input sound and create a platform based on the pitch. When the user presses Spacebar, the game starts and the mic stops reacting to input, and gravity begins working. The goal of the game is to navigate the ball using the pitch based platforms.</p>
	<p>Originally, the idea was to create a program that would create platforms based on either mp3 file input or microphone input, but mp3 files ended up being difficult to use with the pitch-determining scripts. To add a goal, a moderately sized point-awarding squares were included, which ended up being difficult to obtain anyway due to the unnaturalness of the control system. To add a more artistic touch, the color of the ball changes depending on the color of the goal square obtained, as well as particles on every collision.</p>
